Project Title: Predicting Nifty50 Stock Trends

Description:

This project leverages machine learning, specifically RandomForestClassifier and HistGradientBoostingClassifier, to predict the trends of Nifty50 stock market index.
The historical stock data, obtained using the yfinance library, is processed and features are engineered to enhance prediction accuracy.
A comprehensive backtesting framework is implemented, allowing users to evaluate the model's performance over different time horizons.
The model is trained on various predictors including closing prices, volume, and additional technical indicators for robust predictions.
The backtesting results, precision scores, and visualizations provide insights into the effectiveness of the predictive models.
Key Features:

Utilizes RandomForestClassifier and HistGradientBoostingClassifier for prediction tasks.
Implements backtesting to evaluate model performance over different time periods.
Features engineered from historical stock data to enhance prediction accuracy.
Comprehensive analysis of precision scores and visualizations for model evaluation.
Dependencies:

Python libraries: yfinance, pandas, scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and visualization
How to Use:

Install the required libraries using !pip install yfinance pandas scikit-learn.
Load historical Nifty50 data and preprocess it using the provided Jupyter Notebook.
Train the models with different predictors and evaluate their performance using backtesting.
Gain insights into stock trend predictions and make informed decisions.
Note:

The RandomForestClassifier is used with tuned hyperparameters for traditional machine learning.
The HistGradientBoostingClassifier is employed for handling NaN values and providing improved accuracy.
Feel free to explore and contribute to this project, and don't forget to check the backtesting results and precision scores for a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance. Happy predicting!
